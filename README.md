To quote from an article from [Log Rocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/why-use-redux-reasons-with-clear-examples-d21bffd5835/):

<blockquote>One simple answer to this question is you will realize for yourself when you need Redux. If you’re still confused as to whether you need it, you don’t. This usually happens when your app grows to the scale where managing app state becomes a hassle; and you start looking out for making it easy and simple.</blockquote>
