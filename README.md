# Redux Toolkit Tutorial

Simple Redux Toolkit example from [Redux Toolkit - Quick Start](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start) to demonstrate the basics and when to use it. 

## When to use Redux/Redux Toolkit?

This is the reason why I publish this repository to GitHub. Although I'm aware of Redux as big companies keep asking for React/Redux experience, I never had to use it while building my clients' apps. Yes, the scope of these apps were fairly small, so why bother complicating it?

To quote from an article of [Log Rocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/why-use-redux-reasons-with-clear-examples-d21bffd5835/):

<blockquote>One simple answer to this question is you will realize for yourself when you need Redux. If you’re still confused as to whether you need it, you don’t. This usually happens when your app grows to the scale where managing app state becomes a hassle; and you start looking out for making it easy and simple.</blockquote>

## Why choose Redux Toolkit over Redux?

Nowadays, unlike classic Redux, Redux Toolkit is much more updated, easier to setup, develop and deploy. With this given example of increasing or decreasing the counter,  you will be able to see how similar it is to React useState.
